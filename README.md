# Restaurant Recommendation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a personalized restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences. Leveraging machine learning techniques and content-based filtering, the system analyzes restaurant attributes and user preferences to provide relevant recommendations. The recommendation system enhances user satisfaction and streamlines the restaurant selection process by delivering tailored suggestions tailored to individual tastes.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizes user preferences and restaurant attributes to generate tailored restaurant suggestions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends restaurants based on similarity to user preferences, focusing on attributes such as cuisine type and aggregate rating.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates system performance using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics to ensure the quality of recommendations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and accommodate diverse user preferences for scalability and flexibility.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input preferences and view recommended restaurants.
